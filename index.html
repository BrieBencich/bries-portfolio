            Hi, my name is Brie Bencich. I am currently enrolled in University of Toronto's Web Development Bootcamp.
            I am very excited to start my career in the tech industry. A little about me, I've graduated from Urban planning, 
            out of school I became a Fibre Engineer, at Rogers. I love doing that, but I would like to have more oppotunities. 
            In college, we did a bit of coding and it's where I became very interested in it. I look forward to learning 
            more in this wide topic, and hopfully becoming a professional one day. 
          </p>
